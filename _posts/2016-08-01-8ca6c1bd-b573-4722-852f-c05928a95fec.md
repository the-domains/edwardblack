Go ahead and cut with your pen  
Spill your feelings and thoughts.   
They're all bullshit. 

Use your pointed round dagger.  
Manipulate her mind.  
Your twisted words inside her.  
Cursing her thoughts, and leaving her blind.

It's anguish indeed,  
To make me watch her suffering.  
It's a broken reality, tearing at the seems.  
All I can do is wail and weep,  
The people - they know nothing.  
Content ignorance - the city sleeps.
