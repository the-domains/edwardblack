> Just cut me right at the knees,  
> The two pieces I need  
> Destroy what's left of my body  
> But only separately!
> 
> It's a poison that tastes of ink  
> What's this gift you could give me  
> After all this time, so suddenly
> 
> With lips like sin, and hands so soothing  
> You build me up to fall, confusing  
> The last shred of hope, consuming  
> All that I am, because I now see  
> That nobody has or ever will love you like I do  
> That nobody would let you hurt them this way  
> But every second was worth it because I love you  
> Even still, it's all the wrong choices you make. 
> 
> Maybe one day this pain will be a distant memory  
> Until then I'll hold on and fight with everything  
> Hoping just to be the emery  
> That saves us from the suffering
> 
> I hope the moon burns you down  
> And the sun tears you up  
> The tears of heaven fall around  
> And my screams reach you,  
> Here on this dying world
